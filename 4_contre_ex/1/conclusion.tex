  We have presented a new CounterExample Guided Abstraction Refinement
  procedure for the verification of infinite-state systems whose
  states are represented by trees. Transitions are defined using
  rewriting rules and abstractions using equations. This work equip
  the equational abstraction framework~\cite{MeseguerPM-TCS08} with
  counterexample extraction and automatic refinement. Our next
  objective is to implement and evaluate our approach. Our technique
  should be applied to systems that are out of the scope
  of~\cite{BCHK08,BHRV06a} and should be more efficient as we do avoid
  intermediary potentially computation intensive determinization and
  inclusion checks.

A challenge in our implementation will be to develop efficient
strategies to refine the abstraction (see the discussion in Section
\ref{subsec:refinementstep}). In a second step, we are definitively
interested in extending our theory to more complex properties. As an
example, one could consider special classes of liveness properties
that were introduced in \cite{BLW04b} for parametric systems.
